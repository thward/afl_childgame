# AFL Children's game

A solution to the AFL Children's game code challenge. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- Maven
- GIT
- JDK 1.8 


### Installing

From the project root run the following maven goals:


```
mvn clean install
```  

## Running the tests

Test cases are automatically run as part of the maven build process

## Running the program

Once built the program can be run by executing ChildrensGame.class

```
java -cp ChildrensGame-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar childrensgame.ChildrensGame
```

The program provides a command line interface allowing the user to specify the number of children in the circle, and the count until the next child is eliminated from the circle.
